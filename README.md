# react-basic-with-vite

Hello everyone, today I'm coding the react with vite! Let's see all my code!

## What is Reactjs?

React is the most popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs). It gives excellent response speed to user input using a new method of rendering web pages.

Components of this tool are developed by Facebook. It was launched as an open source JavaScript engine in 2013. It is now ahead of major competitors like Angular and Bootstrap, the two best-selling JavaScript libraries of the time.

## What is Vitejs?

Vite is a build tool that uses a module bundler called Rollup, highly optimized for generating static content (css, html).

Originally, ViteJS was built specifically for VueJS. Later, Vite expanded to support React, Preact and Svelteâ€¦
